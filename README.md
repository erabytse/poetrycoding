# PoetryCoding™

> **Code like you’re writing a poem — because you are.**

PoetryCoding™ is a movement founded by **[erabytse](https://erabytse.github.io/)** to restore care, silence, and intention to software.

It is not a framework. Not a linter. Not a trend.  
It is a **stance**.

We believe code can:
- remember without hoarding,
- protect without locking,
- vanish without erasing,
- speak only when necessary.

This repository is the home of the PoetryCoding philosophy.

“If this resonates, you need not speak. Just place a stone: fork, add a .txt with one line of care in /stones/, and leave.”

## 📜 Manifesto for PoetryCoding™

> PoetryCoding is not a method. It is a stance.  
>  
> We code as we write poetry:  
> — with restraint,  
> — with reverence for what is said *and* what is left unsaid,  
> — with care for every word, every space, every silence.  
>  
> Code is not merely a tool. It is a gesture.  
> A gesture that can be violent… or tender.  
> That can accumulate… or release.  
> That can forget… or remember.  
>  
> **PoetryCoding** chooses the latter.  
> It refuses digital excess.  
> It honors broken links without erasing them (`erabytse-tomb`).  
> It protects without locking away (`erabytse-veil`).  
> It cleans without judgment (`erabytse-sweep`).  
>  
> This is not “pretty” code.  
> This is *just* code.  
>  
> **PoetryCoding™ is a movement founded by erabytse.**  
> It belongs to everyone who believes coding can be an act of care.
